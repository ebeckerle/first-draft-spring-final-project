## Overview

This is an enterprise application for a small trades company.  The intent is to simplify the submission of employee timesheets 
in a way that makes the data from those timesheets easily accessible in order to better understand how time is spent to improve
future bids and billings.

## Features

#### Employee Portal
Employees will be able to login to their own personal portal.  There they will be able to create, edit, and submit timesheets
for each week of work.  

#### Supervisor Portal
Supervisors will be able to login to their own personal portal.  There they will be able to manage employees: add a new employee
to the system, retire an employee, edit an employee's profile, and view and approve employees' timesheets.  Supervisors will be 
able to manage projects: they will be able to add projects, edit project details, and retire projects. Supervisors will be able
to view metrics: they will be able to pull up timesheet data to view the data by different factors (example: view total hours
by employee, or total hours by project, or view total hours by project for a specific employee), they will be able to download
that data in a csv format, and they will be able to view that data in different visualizations (ie. bar graph, scatter plot, etc.)
